## What's This?

Once upon a time, part of the ["Blogger" project](https://github.com/Hydraulisc/Blogger). <sup>Read [here](https://blog.hydraulisc.net/blog/) for more info</sup>

This is the official [Hydraulisc Blog Site](https://blog.hydraulisc.net).

This site reads data from a GitHub Actions Generated JSON database, and displays it in a not-so-fancy way. Oh, and it's got a retro theme going, too.

Largely inspired by [TallerThanShort's Blog](https://tallerthanshort.is-a.dev/blog), and [Modders Delight](https://sleepingami.github.io/modders-delight).

## Contributors, read below!

- Whilst **contributions _are_ welcome**, we are only likely to accept contributions that make the site load faster, look better, or correct dumb mistakes.
- Please note that this site ***ONLY*** loads data from a JSON Database, which is automatically generated by a GitHub Action.
